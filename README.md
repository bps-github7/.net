### .net repository-

#### brief implementation of a .net web api

right now, it can handle two GET requests to the following endpoint

```
/api/commands
/api/commands/{command_id}
```

#### After getting it hooked up to a database
development should move quickly, expanding the repitore of possible Http Requests it can accept.
after development and testing on the .net side is finished, a small Angular front end will be constructed to handle sending of requests.
