-- Programmer: Ben Sehnert
-- date: 11/22/2020
-- software: CommanderApi
-- Purpose: Initialize the database for CommanderApi- create users, database and connect to it.

-- note: to use this script, you must copy it to the directory containing the sql-express executable.

-- for docker: 
-- $ docker cp commander_db.sql sql-server-db:/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd
-- then run the following
-- $ docker exec -it sql-server-db "bash"
-- $ /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P super_DUPER_password -i commander_db.sql

-- something weird happened with this script- running the above command seemed to 
-- alter the sqlcmd executable in some way. Whenever i try to open the db ( without -i argument for the input file)
-- I get errors indicating that it is trying to run that script.

--DEV notes: I updated the script with SQL queries that should work- check example invokation online before proceeding.
-- the solution was I had to create a LOGIN, then connect to the database and make a USER for that LOGIN. Ayye Ayye Ayye.
